# Titanic Survival Dataset
My first data analysis/data visualization using Python and required modules and libraries. This is a scatterplot visualization of all the Titanic passengers who survived and perished after Titanic's collision and sinking on April 15, 1912.

### Features and Skills
- Dataset based on a CSV file
- NumPy with Pandas to merge, group, and aggregate various data
- Matplotlib with Seaborn for the scatterplot visualization

### Notes
This is my very first taste in data analysis, data visualization, and data science with Python. I'm not a very good math, statistics, or probability person, but working with big data using Python and its various modules and libraries made data analysis fun. I heard that data science/data analysis is one of the fastest growing fields in the job market right now, so if I don't succeed in web development, I may consider data science for a job field.
